Tool to build fedora package branches

## Description

fedbrnch is a Fedora Packager client which tries to automate some common tasks
like:

- creating package reviews
- listing approved package reviews
- requesting repo and branches
- importing new packages
- building a package across releases

## Installation

Run `cabal new-install` or `stack install` in a git checkout.

## Contributing

This is still in development: feedback and contributions are welcome.

## Usual disclaimer
While this is already working quite well for me,
if it breaks things for you, you get to keep the pieces.
Bug reports are particularly welcome. :-)
